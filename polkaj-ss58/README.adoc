== SS58 Encoding

SS58 is a simple address format designed for Substrate based chains.

The basic idea is a base-58 encoded value which can identify a specific account on the Substrate chain.
Different chains have different means of identifying accounts.
SS58 is designed to be extensible for this reason.

The basic format conforms to:
----
base58encode ( concat ( <address-type>, <address>, <checksum> ) )
----
